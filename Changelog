VDE 2.2.1, 2008-06-17
	* New contact email address: <info@v2.cs.unibo.it>
	* Code cleanup (some more warnings removed)
	* [vde_crytcab] Cleared large memory leak due to missing
	  EVP_CIPHER_CTX_cleanup() after encryption/decryption
	* [vde_cryptcab] Cleared (very small) memory leak in crc32 calls
	* [vde_cryptcab] Fixed bug on handover after session timeout: now client

	  timeout.
	* Heavy directories reorganization, all source code moved under src and
	  include
	* New internal library libvdecommon.la with common utilities and LIBOBJ
	  replacement/compatibility functions
	* [common] Fix in poll emulation management
	* Fix to distclean problem due to wrong LIBOBJ management
	* [vde_switch] hash/setsize 0 was not recognized as an error and caused vde_switch
	  to hang due to an infinite loop
	* Don't compile cryptcab if configure detects not to.
	* Fix for autotools in Slackware
	* [vde_cryptcab] refactoring:
	  - simplified protocol (though keeping it back-compatible)
	  - fixed some bugs and memory leaks
	  - added some new features
	* [vde_switch] fix on BPDU generation/handling: do not generate BPDU if FSTP is not active
	  or we are HUB, forward BPDU if FSTP is not active (Closes #1943973 on SF).
	* [slirpvde] include limits.h on linux as well.
	* [vde_switch] Applied patch from Bjorn Mork to remove 32/64 bit confusion from bitarray.h
	  (Closes #1984460 on SF).
	* [vde_switch] do not update last_seen in hash entry if data arrives from
	  a new port and entry still contains old port (Closes #469098 debian).
	* [vde_cryptcab] server side:
	  - Added feature: cleanup key files on exit
	  - Bugfix: avoid using several switch ports for the same client
	* [vde_switch][libvdeplug] fixed path management: as paths are sent between
	  different processes with potentially different CWDs, we must assure that the
	  exchanged paths are always absolute ones.
	  - added vde_realpath (similar to realpath(3) but with the resulting path
	    well-defined also in case of partial resolution), taken from xmview's
	    canonicalize. vde_realpath is now part of libvdecommon.
	  - [vde_switch, kvde_switch] socket name in datasock gets canonicalized
	  - [vde_switch, kvde_switch] restored CWD of the switch after each module
	    initialization (so each module initializes with the same CWD. consmgmt
	    called daemon(0, 0) which changed the CWD to /, so the behavior was
	    different when the switch ran in background or in foreground.
	  - [vde_switch] clarified some error messages
	  - [libvdeplug] improved the fallback mechanism in case of no socket
	    specified on the command line and for data socket directory. Now the
	    default positions for the ctlfd are tried only if socket is specified.
	  - [libvdeplug] socket names get canonicalized
	  - [libvdeplug] added a missing / in datasock name
	* [kvde_switch] added a missing include
	* [slirpvde] added some checks for successful connection to the VDE switch.
	* integrations and corrections to some manual pages
	* [libvdemgmt] fixed memory leaks (Closes: #1948369 on SF)
